https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=264779809

[SP] While the war between NATO and Opfor are in a standstill on Altis, insurgent forces wreak havoc across local sites. In the front lines against 
these rebels is a counter-terrorism task force, codenamed "Blue Spear." Operating out of airfields on both Stratis and Altis, they are able to strike 
anywhere, at anytime. Although their existence is secret, they have helped save the lives of countless people around the globe.
