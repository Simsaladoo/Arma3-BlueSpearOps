## Arma 3 - Blue Spear Operations

https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=264779809

[SP] While the war between NATO and Opfor are in a standstill on Altis, insurgent forces wreak havoc across local sites. In the front lines against 
these rebels is a counter-terrorism task force, codenamed "Blue Spear." Operating out of airfields on both Stratis and Altis, they are able to strike 
anywhere, at anytime. Although their existence is secret, they have helped save the lives of countless people around the globe.

This repository houses the mission files for all campaign missions, numbered ones representing the published campaign ops.


## Campaigns

The Blue Spear Operations are split up into volumes in the Workshop Collections.  They are as follows:

-Blue Spear Ops I: Brass Hearts
-Blue Spear Ops II: Black Carrion
-Blue Spear Ops III: Critical Mass

ALL of the missions are also added to the now 25-mission mega Collection:
-Blue Spear Operations: Counter-terrorism Task Force

Its much easier to just use the mega collection, but the Volumes look better and help with visibility in the store.
This also lends itself to being more curated towards separate storylines if we ever have a proper story arc implemented.
